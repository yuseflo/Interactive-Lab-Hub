# Staging Interaction

In the original stage production of Peter Pan, Tinker Bell was represented by a darting light created by a small handheld mirror off-stage, reflecting a little circle of light from a powerful lamp. Tinkerbell communicates her presence through this light to the other characters. See more info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker_Bell). 

There is no actor that plays Tinkerbell--her existence in the play comes from the interactions that the other characters have with her.

For lab this week, we draw on this and other inspirations from theatre to stage interactions with a device where the main mode of display/output for the interactive device you are designing is lighting. You will plot the interaction with a storyboard, and use your computer and a smartphone to experiment with what the interactions will look and feel like. 

_Make sure you read all the instructions and understand the whole of the laboratory activity before starting!_



## Prep

### To start the semester, you will need:
1. Read about Git [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F).
2. Set up your own Github "Lab Hub" repository to keep all you work in record by [following these instructions](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/blob/2021Fall/readings/Submitting%20Labs.md).
3. Set up the README.md for your Hub repository (for instance, so that it has your name and points to your own Lab 1) and [learn how to](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) organize and post links to your submissions on your README.md so we can find them easily.


### For this lab, you will need:
1. Paper
2. Markers/ Pens
3. Scissors
4. Smart Phone -- The main required feature is that the phone needs to have a browser and display a webpage.
5. Computer -- We will use your computer to host a webpage which also features controls.
6. Found objects and materials -- You will have to costume your phone so that it looks like some other devices. These materials can include doll clothes, a paper lantern, a bottle, human clothes, a pillow case, etc. Be creative!

### Deliverables for this lab are: 
1. 7 Storyboards
1. 3 Sketches/photos of costumed devices
1. Any reflections you have on the process
1. Video sketch of 3 prototyped interactions
1. Submit the items above in the lab1 folder of your class [Github page], either as links or uploaded files. Each group member should post their own copy of the work to their own Lab Hub, even if some of the work is the same from each person in the group.

### The Report
This README.md page in your own repository should be edited to include the work you have done (the deliverables mentioned above). Following the format below, you can delete everything but the headers and the sections between the **stars**. Write the answers to the questions under the starred sentences. Include any material that explains what you did in this lab hub folder, and link it in your README.md for the lab.

## Lab Overview

## Part A. Plan 

**Describe your setting, players, activity and goals here.**
The interactive device is designed for the usage in the kitchen. The interaction starts when someone is opening the fridge. Anyone that uses the fridge can be a Player. When the fridge is closed, then it indicates a green light. From the moment when the user opens the fridge, it changes the color to red. When the fridge is open for a longer time, then a warning sound plays to make the household members aware that someone forgot to close the fridge. The job of the user is to put food into and get food from the fridge. The main goal is to do the user's job efficient without increasing the temperature of the products in the fridge.  

**Include pictures of your storyboards here.**

**Summarize feedback you got here.**
* playing sound is very intuitive and it is very likely to leave the fridge door for a longer time open
* light is not very bright and good positioned


## Part B. Act out the Interaction


**Are there things that seemed better on paper than acted out?**
* It is always possible that there is a delay when the light switches colors from green to red. 
* The sound that plays may be either too loud or playing for too long.

**Are there new ideas that occur to you or your collaborators that come up from the acting?**
* Blinking red light to give the user another visual indication that the fridge remained for a longer time open. 


## Part C. Prototype the device

**Give us feedback on Tinkerbelle.**
It is a great tool, that works very well. However, it would be better if you could hide the two buttons on the mobile device in order to fully display the color. It would be also great if there would be a button that enables blinking of the UI.


## Part D. Wizard the device

**Include your first attempts at recording the set-up video here.**

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91849980/187335806-6dc8afea-0d20-4dd2-a0d1-9352dce675e6.mp4

Now, hange the goal within the same setting, and update the interaction with the paper prototype. 

**Show the follow-up work here.**

After recording the setup for the first time, I realized that stability of the device is necessary to ensure that the device did not get destroyed by accident. Since the device is not necessary heavy, the connection between fridge and device should be strong. 

## Part E. Costume the device

**Include sketches of what your devices might look like here.**

![Lab-3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91849980/187339356-5270c0a7-477f-49cd-8da2-f59c046c3510.jpg)

**What concerns or opportunitities are influencing the way you've designed the device to look?**

The main reason for designing the device on top of the fridge and not on the front is that when the fridge is open then the device would be attached to the door and would not be in the eyesight of the user. However, when designing the device on top of the fridge, we have to make sure that there is a certain elevation of the object to let the user see the color of the device better. In general, different shapes can be used to design the device but I would tend to the design that ensures the best stability on the fridge's surface. 


## Part F. Record

**Take a video of your prototyped interaction.**

# Staging Interaction, Part 2 

This describes the second week's work for this lab activity.


## Prep (to be done before Lab on Wednesday)

You will be assigned three partners from another group. Go to their github pages, view their videos, and provide them with reactions, suggestions & feedback: explain to them what you saw happening in their video. Guess the scene and the goals of the character. Ask them about anything that wasn’t clear. 

\*\***Summarize feedback from your partners here.**\*\*

## Make it your own

Do last week’s assignment again, but this time: 
1) It doesn’t have to (just) use light, 
2) You can use any modality (e.g., vibration, sound) to prototype the behaviors! Again, be creative! Feel free to fork and modify the tinkerbell code! 
3) We will be grading with an emphasis on creativity.


## Part A. Plan 

**Describe your setting, players, activity and goals here.**
The interactive device is designed for the usage in the kitchen. The interaction starts when someone wants to cook. Anyone that uses the stove can be a Player. When you want to cook, then it is often the case that you forget the food because you were busy with other things. When the food gets burnt, then there is no alarm indicating that there might be a problem with the food. This device can be set up to a specific dish you want to cook and gives you visual, haptic as well as auditory feedback if you should go check the food. It can also be used as clock, where for specific dishes it tells you when to lower the heat. The goal of the player is to not waste time worrying about if the food burns, so that they can focus on assignments or guests for instance.  

**Include pictures of your storyboards here.**

## Part B. Act out the Interaction


**Are there things that seemed better on paper than acted out?**
* It is very hard to attach the product to the bottom of the shelf and still be user-friendly
* When the device is vibrating frequently, then the shelf might break

**Are there new ideas that occur to you or your collaborators that come up from the acting?**
* The device could adjust the heat of the stove automatically


## Part C. Prototype the device

**Give us feedback on Tinkerbelle.**
It is a great tool, that works very well. However, it would be better if you could hide the two buttons on the mobile device in order to fully display the color. It would be also great if there would be a button that enables blinking of the UI.

## Part D. Wizard the device

**Include your first attempts at recording the set-up video here.**

Now, hange the goal within the same setting, and update the interaction with the paper prototype.

I narrowed the ideas down to 3. 

The ideas include:
